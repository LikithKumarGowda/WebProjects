    <p>Times New Roman is a serif typeface. It was commissioned by the British newspaper <br/> The Times in 1931 and conceived by Stanley Morison, the artistic adviser to the <br/>British branch of the printing equipment company Monotype, in collaboration with Victor Lardent,<br /> a lettering artist in The Times's advertising department. It has become one of the most <br/>popular typefaces of all time and is installed on most desktop computers.<br/>

Asked to advise on a redesign, Morison recommended that The Times change their<br/> text typeface from a spindly nineteenth-century face to a more robust, <br/>solid design, returning to traditions of printing from the eighteenth century and before.<br/> This matched a common trend in printing tastes of the period. Morison proposed an older <br/>Monotype typeface named Plantin as a basis for the design, and Times New Roman <br/>mostly matches Plantin's dimensions. The main change was that the contrast <br/>between strokes was enhanced to give a crisper image. The new design made its<br/> debut in The Times on 3 October 1932. After one year, the design was released for <br/>commercial sale. In Times New Roman's name, Roman is a reference to the regular or <br/>roman style (sometimes also called Antiqua), the first part of the Times New Roman family <br/>to be designed. Roman type has roots in Italian printing of the late 15th and <br/>early 16th centuries, but Times New Roman's design has no connection <br/>to Rome or to the Romans.

The Times stayed with Times New Roman <br/>for 40 years, but new production techniques and the format change from broadsheet to tabloid in <br/>2004 have caused it to switch typeface five times from 1972 to 2007. However, all <br/>the new fonts have been variants of the original New Roman typeface.</p>
